	 * The Component c is Centered within it and has a minimum Size of its
	 * preferred size and grows. The growth is as big in the component as in the
	 * border, meaning, that the extra width/height of the component is as big
	 * as the width of the border on both sides of it. <br>
	 * bg determines the Background Color which could also be set afterwards,
	 * but the possibility to add it in the Constructor can save a few lines,
	 * e.g. you can just add it
	 * like<code> add(new AdjustableBorderPanel(comp, Color.GREY));</code> and
	 * only create comp beforehand. This saves you two lines (Construction of
	 * the AdjustableBorderPanel and setting of the Background).

	 *            The Component put on this AdjustableBorderPanel
	 * @param bg
