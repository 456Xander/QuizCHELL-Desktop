# QuizCHELL-Java
The Desktop Version of QuizCHELL.

QuizCHELL is a quiz game for the HTL Salzburg based around the things you learn in that school. Since that school is in Austria the whole game is in german. But we will try to keep the questions simple to understand, so that everybody can use the game. It could also be a great way to learn the german words for technical terms.
The game offers an option the submit a new question which will instantly be available for all players using the game via a MySQL database. So please don't add silly or joke questions and make sure there is only one right answer and it is the one with green background.
